    <p>Y'all know what's going down!  But I bet you didn't know in the 1800's this is how people made lemonade—you can do it too! It's not that difficult, and tastes wonderful!</p> 
        <br><br>
<p>Ingredients
    <br>  <br><ul>
5 lemons
<br>
1 ¼ cups white sugar
<br>
1 ¼ quarts water
</ul>
    <br><br> </P>
    Directions

    <br>  <br>
    Peel the rinds from the 5 lemons and cut them into 1/2 inch slices. Set the lemons aside.
    <br>
    Place the rinds in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them. Let this stand for about one hour, so that the sugar begins to soak up the oils from the lemons.
    <br>
    Bring water to a boil in a covered saucepan and then pour the hot water over the sugared lemon rinds. Allow this mixture to cool for 20 minutes and then remove the rinds.
    <br>
    Squeeze the lemons into another bowl. Pour the juice through a strainer into the sugar mixture. Stir well, pour into pitcher and pop it in the fridge! Serve with ice cubes.
